# TIL — CSS: object-fit vs background-size
Date: 2025-09-27

Summary:
- `object-fit` → use for `<img>` / `<video>` elements (replaced elements).
- `background-size` → use for CSS background images.
- `object-fit: cover` crops while preserving aspect ratio.

Example:
```html
<img src="photo.jpg" style="width:200px;height:150px;object-fit:cover">

(If the triple-backticks inside the snippet break the editor, paste without the inner code fence lines — the text still counts.)

---

### 5) Scroll down to the **Commit new file** area (bottom of the page)
You’ll see a box with:
- a **Commit message** field (single line),
- a **Commit description** (optional),
- two radio options:
  - **Commit directly to the `main` branch.**
  - **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**

**Important:** To get a *commit + PR* in one flow, pick the second radio option.

**Exactly do this:**
- Click the radio button **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** (it’s the one below).
- In the branch name field GitHub suggests a name. Replace it with this branch name (or keep the suggestion):


- In the **Commit message** field paste this single-line message:


- Leave **Commit description** empty (optional).

---

### 6) Click **Propose new file**
- That button is below the commit box. Click **Propose new file**.

What happens: GitHub creates the branch, commits the new file to that branch, and immediately opens a pull request (PR) composer page. You have completed the commit step.

---

### 7) Fill the PR form and create the Pull Request
You’re on the “Open a pull request” screen now. There are two fields: **Title** and **Leave a comment** (PR description).

**Copy/paste these exact values:**

- **PR Title** (replace the existing title if needed):


- **PR description** (paste into the big text box):


(You can optionally add reviewers, labels, or assignees later; not necessary.)

- Now click the **Create pull request** green button.

---

## You’re done — what you just created
- One **commit** on a new branch (visible in the branch history).  
- One **Pull Request** opened from that branch into `main`.  
- Both actions are recorded in GitHub activity; the **PR counts as a PR** in your profile and the **commit will be counted** once it’s merged into the default branch (or might appear as authored by you already for PR activity).

---

## Optional: Merge the PR (one more click to actually put commit into `main`)
If you want the commit to land on `main` (so it definitely shows in contribution graphs):

1. On the PR page, find the big green **Merge pull request** button near the bottom.
2. Click **Merge pull request**.
3. Click **Confirm merge**.

This will merge the branch into `main` and the commit will be part of the default branch history (best for contribution counts).

> Note: If the **Merge** button is disabled, you may need to click **Squash and merge** or **Rebase and merge** (drop-down next to merge); choose **Squash and merge** if available and confirm. For tiny docs PRs this is fine.

---

## Quick troubleshooting (common beginner issues)
- **I don’t see the Add file button.** — Make sure you are on the repo’s main page (click the repo name under “Your repositories”). On forks sometimes UI differs; use your own repository for clean counting.
- **My commit didn’t show on my profile.** — Make sure the email used for commits is associated with your GitHub account. If you used the GitHub web editor, commits are attributed automatically to your account.
- **I clicked “Propose new file” but no PR page opened.** — That means you likely picked “Commit directly to main” — instead, pick the “Create a new branch…” radio before proposing the file.
- **Merge button greyed out.** — The repository might require checks or reviews; in your own repo you can change settings, or use the dropdown to select “Squash and merge”.

If you want, I can now:
- Give the exact same step-by-step for creating **three** PRs in a row (with filenames and branch names) so you can repeat the flow quickly, **or**
- Guide you through doing this live for *your specific repo* name (I’ll generate the filenames/branch names and texts ready to paste).
